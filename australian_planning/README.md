#What sort of jobs can I do with my Australian working holiday visa?

>From fruit picking to bartending, there are a large variety of jobs filled by backpackers on a working holiday in Australia. The most popular jobs include fruit picking, waitressing, farm work and other types of labour such as construction.

>The types of jobs available will depend on where in Australia you are. So if you’re in Melbourne for a month or two, you might want to try office temping, working in a shop or waiting on tables. If you’re somewhere more remote, then farm work may be more easy to find.

>Top tip: If you want to apply to extend your working holiday visa to two years, you’ll need to have completed at least 3 months of qualifying farm work. So it’s a good idea to decide early on if you want to stay for two years. Even though farm work can be tough, you will probably enjoy the experience more than you think. The type and amount of farm work available will depend on the season and your location.

#How to get Your working holiday tax refund

>When it comes to getting a tax refund from your working holiday in Australia, the key thing to remember is that the longer you stay, the more likely you are to be due a refund. The current average income tax refund is $2600 so it’s always worth finding out if you’re due tax back using this online tax calculator. You can apply for a tax refund both while you’re still in Australia, or once you get home.

>And don’t forget that when you leave Australia and your visa has expired or been cancelled, you can apply for a refund of your superannuation, which can run into the thousands of dollars, depending on how long you worked in Oz. For more tips and advice, visit Taxback.
