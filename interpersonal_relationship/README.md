Interpersonal skills are the skills we use every day when we communicate and interact with other people, both individually and in groups.

People with strong interpersonal skills are often more successful in both their professional and personal lives.

Interpersonal skills include a wide variety of skills, though many are centred around communication, such as listening, questioning and understanding body language. They also include the skills and attributes associated with emotional intelligence, or being able to understand and manage your own and othersâ€™ emotions.
